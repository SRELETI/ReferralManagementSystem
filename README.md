# ReferralManagementSystem
Android Application, Java, SQLite

ReferralManagementSystem is an android app 

Ontario’s current referral landscape is complex, characterized by inconsistent processes for referring patients to programs and health services. Some of the most significant patient safety and quality issues in Ontario’s healthcare system occur as people transition from one care provider to the next. To address these concerns, we have built a Referrals Management System
 . This app can be accessed by DischargePlanners and CCAC agents. The DischargePlanners can use this app for filling out of the referral forms with all the details and the CCAC agents can use this app for searching beds in Long Term Care Centers.
 
The project can be run by downloading the source code and running it in eclipse or android studio. Everything is set up and ready to run.
